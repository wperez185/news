## Description

This is my app that gives you the option to choose from many categories to find a article of your interest. I hope you enjoy it and Happy Reading.

Click on the dropdown option to select a category that interests you. A second dropdown option will be displayed with subcategories that you can choose from. The results will be returned so you can choose any article you would like to read. Also you have the back to top button if you do not find any article of your liking to choose a different category.
